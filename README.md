## üí° Problems and Solutions

1. **Generating a Random Password**:
    - **Problem**: How to create a random password according to the selected options.
    - **Solution**: The `handleGeneratePassword` function creates a string based on the selected options (special characters, numbers, uppercase letters). It randomly selects characters from the available character sets.

    ```javascript
    function handleGeneratePassword(passwordLength) {
      let password = '';
      let chars = lowercase;

      if (includeSpecialCharacters) chars += specialCharacters;
      if (includeNumbers) chars += numbers;
      if (includeUppercase) chars += uppercase;

      for (let i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
        password += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length));
      }

      setNewPassword(password);
    }
    ```

2. **Hiding the Password**:
    - **Problem**: How to hide the generated password, displaying it as a series of '*' characters.
    - **Solution**: The `hidePassword` function converts the password to a series of '*' characters. The `showPassword` state controls whether the password is hidden or shown.

    ```javascript
    function hidePassword(newPasswordLength) {
      let password = '';

      for (let i = 0; i < newPasswordLength; i++) {
        password += '*';
      }

      return password;
    }
    ```

3. **Copying the Password to Clipboard**:
    - **Problem**: How to allow the user to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
    - **Solution**: The Clipboard API is used to copy the password when the "Copy" button is clicked.

    ```javascript
    function copyPassword(newPassword) {
      navigator.clipboard.writeText(newPassword);
      alert('Password copied successfully!');
    }
    ```

4. **Managing Application State**:
    - **Problem**: How to store and manage various options and the generated password.
    - **Solution**: The React `useState` hook is used to manage the application's state, including the options for generating the password and the password itself.

    ```javascript
    const [newPassword, setNewPassword] = useState('');
    const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);
    const [passwordLength, setPasswordLength] = useState(10);
    const [includeSpecialCharacters, setIncludeSpecialCharacters] = useState(false);
    const [includeNumbers, setIncludeNumbers] = useState(false);
    const [includeUppercase, setIncludeUppercase] = useState(false);
    ```
